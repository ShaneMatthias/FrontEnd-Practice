React is virtual DOM
DOM is tree-structured
Reconciliation: Syncing DOM to Virtual Dom
Diffing: defrentiating copy previous DOM to update DOM
Declaring keys on elements to increase performance when adding to top of list

var is function scope
let is block scope

" == "" compares value
" === " compares type

you cannot reassign or redeclare a constant
you can add/remove to a const array or const object

undefine = assigned automatically on empty declaration
null = assigned by you
type of null = object
type of undefined = undefined
both are empty values

function decleration = function func() cannot be passed into another function
function expression let func = function() cannot be called before its declared
behaves like a variable

normal functions: "this" depends on function invocation 
arrow functions: "this" is always referring to the outer function

simple invocation, method invocation, 
indirect invocation, constructor invocation

arguments in arrow function is taken from parent function
accessing direct arguments of the arrow function requires
the rest parameters as the function paramter "...args"
